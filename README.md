# leland-api

The leland-api project is a cheeky idea I thought of when trying to come up with a personal website

### 10/07 Update
I would like to try to use the Play Framework in order to try to learn Scala and working with a non-blocking I/O framework.

Baby Steps:
1. Create a Hello World application which pulls my Github info.

### The Idea
My personal website will be an REST API specification with its own in-page client for calling a web service which will serve information about me which I choose to expose

### Why would anyone ever want to do that?
// TODO: I'm wasting too much time trying to word this

/ * Anyway, I want to take this project as an opportunity to learn a lot of stuff I don't focus on in my day job like node.js, AWS, and much more. * /

### Goals
* Design a basic REST API spec page 
* Include an in-page web client
* Use the MERN stack to implement the application
* Track progress on Github

### Stretch Goals
* Deploy the application to AWS
* Add authorization

### Stretch Stretch Stretch Goals
* Allow other users to sign up and plug in their own inteREST API 
* Think of a better name for this idea than inteREST API
